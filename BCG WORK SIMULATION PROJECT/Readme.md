CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS â€“ BCG WORK SIMULATION PROJECT

This project is a BCG Work Simulation from TheForage focusing on identifying and preventing customer churn. The analysis leverages Python and its robust libraries to clean, explore, and engineer features from large customer datasets, culminating in a Random Forest model that achieves 85% accuracy.

Overview:
The project delivers the following key insights:

1. Churn Identification:
Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and exploration to pinpoint key churn indicators.

2. Predictive Modeling:
Engineered features and built a Random Forest classifier, achieving 85% accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

3. Data Visualization:
Created visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight churn trends and present actionable findings in a clear, data-driven narrative.

Technical Details :

- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- Dataset: Large-scale customer dataset with diverse features capturing churn behavior.
- Methodology:
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis to understand customer churn patterns.
- Feature engineering to enhance predictive power.
- Random Forest model implementation with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Visualization of churn trends for effective storytelling.
This README provides an overview of the techniques and results achieved in this churn analysis project, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating customer churn.
